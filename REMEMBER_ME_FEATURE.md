# Remember Me Feature Implementation

## Overview
The "Remember Me" feature has been successfully implemented in the login system. This feature allows users to stay logged in for extended periods when they check the "Remember Me" checkbox during login.

## How It Works

### Session Duration
- **Without Remember Me**: Session expires after 1 day
- **With Remember Me**: Session expires after 30 days

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Frontend (LoginForm Component)
- The login form includes a checkbox for "Remember Me"
- When mounted, the form automatically loads previously remembered email addresses
- If a user was previously remembered, their email is pre-filled and the checkbox is checked
- The remember me state is passed to the authentication handler

#### 2. Authentication (NextAuth Configuration)
- The NextAuth credentials provider accepts a `rememberMe` parameter
- JWT tokens are configured with dynamic expiration based on the remember me option
- Session callbacks store the remember me preference and set appropriate expiration times

#### 3. Local Storage Integration
- When "Remember Me" is checked, the user's email is stored in localStorage
- The remember me preference is also stored for future logins
- Data is cleared when the user logs in without checking "Remember Me"

#### 4. Custom Hook (useRememberMe)
A utility hook is provided for managing remember me functionality throughout the app:

```typescript
import { useRememberMe } from '@/hooks/useRememberMe'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { 
    isRemembered, 
    sessionRememberMe, 
    getTimeUntilExpiry, 
    clearRememberMe 
  } = useRememberMe()
  
  // Use the values as needed
}
```

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
1. `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - NextAuth configuration with dynamic session duration
2. `src/app/auth/page.tsx` - Login handler that passes remember me option
3. `src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` - UI component with remember me checkbox and auto-fill

### Type Definitions
4. `src/types/next-auth.d.ts` - Extended NextAuth types to include remember me properties

### Utilities
5. `src/hooks/useRememberMe.ts` - Custom hook for remember me functionality

## Security Considerations

- Remember me data is stored in localStorage (client-side only)
- JWT tokens still expire according to the configured timeframes
- Sessions are properly validated and can be revoked server-side
- No sensitive information (like passwords) is stored in localStorage

## Testing the Feature

1. Go to the login page
2. Enter valid credentials
3. Check the "Remember Me" checkbox
4. Log in successfully
5. Close and reopen the browser - you should remain logged in
6. Return to the login page - your email should be pre-filled

Without "Remember Me":
1. Log in without checking the box
2. Your session will expire after 1 day
3. Previous remember me data will be cleared

## Future Enhancements

- Add option to "Forget this device" in user settings
- Implement device-specific remember me tokens
- Add security notifications for remembered logins
- Implement session activity monitoring
